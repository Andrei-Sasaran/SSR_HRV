The steps we need to do in order to create a push our changes and merge on the MAIN branch:

1) Git bash in the local folder with the repository
*) git pull while on the main branch to get all the updates.
2) git checkout -b branch-name
3) Do your work
4) git add .
5) git commit -m "A sugestive message"
6) git push origin branch-name

The last step is the most important, this will create a pull request that will open a discusion on github, after aproval the branc with the name
branch-name will be merged onto main branch.
